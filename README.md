## Features

- Provides quick responses to tourist-related questions about Paris.
- Conversational memory allows for context-aware answers.
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for high-quality responses.


## Example Output
Since the API key used in development is no longer valid, hereâ€™s an example output from the code:
